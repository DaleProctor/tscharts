Dependencies
------------

wxPython
Python 3 only

Notes
-----

Rename tscharts/queue, which conflicts with python 3 urllib. May rename
queue to something else (maybe schedqueue) in the future.

Creating a binary for Windows
-----------------------------

Visit pytinstaller.org

On the main page, find PytinStaller Quickstart, and follow the directions.

Make a zip file of the resulting dist/xrayuploader directory and unpack on
the target Windows 10 machine.
